		<p>Hi! I am Kexin Li, doing a Master’s course in Human-Computer Interaction with Ergonomics in Univerisity College London. Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Information Security at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in June, 2014.</p>
		<p>I built up computer science foundation from my undergraduate studies, honed design skills in a studio, and gained practical experience from internships. Passion for interaction design motivates me to seek ways to smooth the technology to impress users. I did some user interface design for websites and Andriod apps before, check out my portfolio!</p>
		<p class="last">Now I literally enjoy my life in London, studying HCI theoretical knowledge and doing design practices as well. </p>
